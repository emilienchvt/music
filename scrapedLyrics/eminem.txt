Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack 
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch 
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back 
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag 
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it 
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets 
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it 
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it 
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment 
'bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick 
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch! 
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren 
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch 
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch 

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long 
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down 
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m. 



So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go 
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket 
Life's too short to not go for broke 
So everybody, everybody, shake your body 

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it? 
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced 
So I guess it ain't 
Dead after shave of cologne that made him just faint 
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint 
So if love is a chess game, check mate 
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, bang -- bang, bang 
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing 
So come get on this kids rock, baw wit da baw, bang bang 
P-p-p-pow pow chicka wow wow 
Catch a cab, I wanna go down, br-bow-bow 
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel 
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how 
At least I know that I don't know 
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid 
Hope so, now ho... 

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long 
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down 
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m. 
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go 
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket 
Life's too short to not go for broke 
So everybody, everybody, get your vials 

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam 
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo 
With the ugly Kardashian 
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low 
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past 
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow 
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow 
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note! 
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn’t everybody know 
Get the bar soap lathered, came ghost and called Arthur’s Cargo's 
Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man 
You bird brained baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman 
Unless you’re a swallow 
Word, w-word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl 
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam 

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long 
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down 
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m. 
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go 
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket 
Life's too short to not go for broke 
So everybody, everybody, shake your body

Jumped out of the second floor of a record store... 
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder 
In Ecuador with Edward Norton 
Eminem speaks out against Donald Trump on "Campaign Speech" 
Witness the metamorphosis 
Of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman 
From the Hessian War and 
Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman 
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan 
Endless sores and reservoir 
Of extension cords in dresser drawers 
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors 
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin 
Excellent boyfriend 
Use intercourse to settle scores 
With women who have been vendettas towards men 
Dickhead is forced in and the shredded foreskin 
Red is torn and they're only bein' fed a portion 
Bed sores in sore shins 
Pregnant whores can get abortions



Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption 
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor 
A predator, I'm headed for competitors 
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals 
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store 
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus 
Yes, of course, I mess up once 
You want some? Come and get some, boys! 
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course 
On excessive force and pressure points 
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange 
Dress and four inch heels to address the court 
With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso 
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him 
In my present form I'm Desert Storm 
Appetite for destruction is no suppressant for 
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel 
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous! 
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus 
Met a contortionist, said, "When you wanna get sexual?" 
She said, "However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible." 
Expired tags on the Saturn, got Catherine Bach 
In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on 
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph 
For this asshole cop's daughter 
Laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it 
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock 
Had a heart attack and dropped dead 
Started fallin' back with it 
And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock 
One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch 
Crack for an axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff, pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel 
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound* 
Asked if they had a laugh in stock 
That was fuckin' stupid… 
You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch 
A doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic 
Bitch, get to massagin' this dick! 
Like spas in this bitch, slob on it, with gobs of lipstick 
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with 
It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with 
She's non-existent 
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some swab and slick shit 
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches 
Misfit, blond and nitwit 
Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit 
Screamed, "I hate blondes," and became one, I'm optimistic 
Love to start shit 
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment 
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx 
I'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble 'cause a double cross 
The shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across 
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults 
A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer 
Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's is 
Something's awful when Dustin Hoffman's 
Dressin' up in your mummy costume 
On stage dancin' to "Brain Damage", what's the problem? 
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status 
Run the faucet, I'ma dunk 
A bunch of Trump supporters underwater 
Snuck up on 'em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan 
It's a wrap, like an Ace bandage 
Don't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last DNA strand 
E&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand 
She wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan 
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say 
Consider me a dangerous man 
But you should be afraid of this dang candidate 
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet 
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin' 
And that's what you wanted 
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button, who doesn't have to answer to no one – great idea! 
If I was president, gettin' off is 
The first order of business once I get in office 
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam 
Naked, laughing, dick cupped in hand 
Screaming, "Fuck safe sex!" 
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him 
Tell Congress I run this land 
And I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy 
Addiction to friction and static 
Addict who can't escape the habit 
It's in you to chase the dragon 
But as fate would have it, I walked up in major Magics 
Dressed as the maintenance man 
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket, with a gauge to blast it 
And sped away in the station wagon 
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's
Crazy asses in the backseat 
Throwin' Stay-Free pads at me 
Dead passenger in the passenger seat 
Unfasten the safety latches 
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard 
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires 
Finna get a murder case and catch it 
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic 
And send Dylan Roof through the windshield of the Benz 
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'... 
Like a windmill with a thin bill while his skin's peelin' 
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar 
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder 
Knock it into the upper peninsula 
You want to go against zilla? The Rap God 
When will I quit? Never been realer 
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt 
Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla 
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer of bin syllable binge 
Fill a syringe, till I 
Draw first blood 
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular 
Couldn't be more awkwarder 
Cause you're innocence I robbed you of 
It's my fingers that got stuck up 
Tortured a, not give a 
Slapstick, hockey puck 
The broad hunter with the sawed off 
Like an arm when it's lopped off of ya 
But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun
Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox 
Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I sharpen 
It's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker 
The rock cuts into rock cause who would have thought 
This much of a cocksucker that go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter 
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned 
I'm unrevealing quickly 
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me 
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey 
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles 
Like what happened to Chris Reeves' spine column 
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems 
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em 
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles 
And why I had to come back on these faggots who diss me is 
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel 
But my patience is wearing thin 
Swear I been contemplating rubbing shit in your face till I smear it in 
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen 
And never appear again 
If you actually had fucking careers to end 
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them 
Molly, I'm gone off you 
Man, light some kush 
You're my first take, I'll nail you 
Can't lie, I gush 
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize 
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push 
You can get it in a can like some Anheuser Busch 
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush 
Mushed against your damn side, you puss 
And thighs are squooshed 
What kind of attires that? 
I'm ready to be rode 
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it popping like a flat 
Light the match to ignite the wrath 
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half 
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me 
Like a scab 
Hard to describe in fact 
Startling violent perhaps 
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that 
And you aren't really surprised at that 
But as far as these lines I rap 
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69'ed the track 
(Why am I such a dick!?)

Yeah, 
You know technically, Im not even really supposed to be here right now, 
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it. 

Ahh ah ah ah eh eh eh eh ehhh 

Yeah, haha 
Feels good, 
Whooo, 
Guess I'm lucky, 
Some of us don't get a second chance. 
But I aint blowing this one. 
Naw man, haha, 
Shit I feel like I can do anything now. 

Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water, 
Commin out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters 

Cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man. 




Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, take his hands an cup 'em, 
Spit a rhyme to freeze the clock, take the hands of time an cuff em. 

Cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man. 

Theres a storm commin that the weather man couldn't predict, 
I start the bug prick, you better flee cause I get ticked 
Its a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked 
I got up I'm back to punch ya to the ground, ya trick, 
Its a trap, fuck my last cd this shits in my trash, 
I be god damned if another rapper gets in my ass, 
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if its my last. 
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat ya eyelashes, 

and keep winking and blown kisses cuz your flirting with death 
Im destroying your livelihood, I aint just hurting your rep, 
I catch a flow and get goin, 
No remorse, I'm showinn they slowin, for no one, 
Knowin there is nothing you can do about it 
Zeroin on the target like a marksman, 
The target is you, 
I shut ya lane down, 
Took ya spot, parked in it too, 
Watchin it flow, lighter fluid, saliva what can ya do, 
Go get ya crew to hype ya up stand behind you like whoooo! 

That boys hot enough to melt hell burn satan too, 
Fry his ass, and put his ashes back together with glue, 
See you can hate em, he don't blame you frankly he would too, 
This game couldn't afford to lose him, how bout you? 

Now guess who who (hey), 
Heres a clue (hey),

Send the fellow Shady dang came to wrap the game up in cellophane, 
Raise hell from hell he came, 
But didn't come to bore you with the cinderella story, 
Nor did he come to do the same, 
He cant afford to be a label in this day in age, 
And at this stage of the game 
Mediocrity cannot be allowed to fly, 
So say bye, 
to the old H I

Consider it his last hurrah 
Coup de grace 
Raise em high in the sky,

Time to bring the place alive, 
Thanks for bein patient

Shit my potatoes baked, 
Homie the veggies on my plate can fly, 
My filet is smoking weed,

Shit I aint even suppose to be here
By the grace of god, 
The skin on my teeth 
And the hair on my nuts I skated by, 
Now y'all are on thin ice 
With ankle weights I hate to lie, 
How fuckin irritated are you, 
How much in ya face am i, 
And ain't shit you can do but fear it 
Proof is here in spirit

Ill mirror it 
When I stand near it,

Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyrics,

Intro: 
Where's my snare? 
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go 
Yeah 
Yo yo 

Verse 1 
Have you ever been hated, or discriminated against? 
I have, I've been protested and demostrated against 
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times 
Sick as the mind, of the mothafuckin' kid that's behind 
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin' 
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin' 
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give em hell long as I'm breathin' 
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin', and takin' names in the evenin' 
Leave them with a taste sour as vinegar in they mouth 
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out 



Look at me now, I betcha prolly sick of me now 
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now 

Chorus (2x) 
I'm sorry mama 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet 

One More Time 

I said, 
I'm sorry mama 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet 
Ha! 

Verse 2 
I got some skeletons in my closet 
And I don't know if no one knows it 
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it 
Imma expose it, I'll take you back to '73 
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD 
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months 
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch 
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye 
No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die 
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side 
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I try to make it work 
With her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes 
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today 
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb 
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun 
Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I woulda shot Kim and them both 
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to The Eminem show 

Chorus (2x) 

Verse 3 
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition 
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin' 
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision 
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen 
Bitchin' that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missin' 
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen Syndrome 
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it? 
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, MA? 
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, MA? 
But guess what, your gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that your phoney 
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful 
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral *hahaha* 
See what hurts me the most, is you wont admit you was wrong 
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom 
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get 
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit! 
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? 
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!! 

Chorus (2x) 




Cause some things just don't change 
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name 
So on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game 
Ooooohhhhhhh 
It shouldn't be difficult to explain 
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame 
Love the game, cold as ice you remain 
Fuck em' all, tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again 

So, god damn... is it that time again already 
Haha, you don't look too happy to see me 
Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once 
All right, fuck ya'll then 

You can get the dick, just call me the ballsac, I'm nuts 
Michael Vick in this bitch, fall back you mutts 
Fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy 
Fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck sick mummy 
And my nuts, lick, gobble 'em up trick, yummy 



Bitch you don't fucking think I know that you suck dick dummy? 
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey 
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny! 
Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words 
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker 
Motherfucker might aswell let my lips pucker 
Like Elton John, cause I'm just a mean cock sucker 
This shit is on, cause you went and pissed me off 
Now I'm sitting and pissing on everybody 
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong 
So buck the buddah, light a bong 
But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, cmon 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows 
When it snows and it's twenty be-low 
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know 
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows 
Oh oh oh oh oh 

Fuck it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth 
Ya'll are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standing 
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out 
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fucking around motherfucker 
I'll show you pussy footin, I'll kick a bitch in the cunt 
Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion 
Who the fuck is you pushin', you musta mistook me for some sissy 
Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom 
Go ahead, fucking hater push me 
I told you ain't no fucking way to shush me 
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy 
Man the fuck up sissy, G's up 
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!) 
Man chill, nah I can't god damnit 
Rap is a landfill, drop the anvil 
These are shoes that you can't fill 
Shit the day that happens the world'll stop spinning 
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a stand still 
During an earthquake, urine in your face 
Cause you're fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait! 
Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening 
Alright then I quit, god I give up 
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do 
This is for your sins, I cleanse you 
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue 
To hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows 
When it snows and it's twenty be-low 
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know 
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows 
Oh oh oh oh oh 

How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day 
Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say 
So long, til then I drop the fucking bombs 
Like I miss the pass when I went long 
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong 
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song 
Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women 
When the aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming 
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo so 
So don't compare me to them other bums over there 
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah 
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair 
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you 
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune 
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme 
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows 
When it snows and it's twenty be-low 
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know 
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows 
Oh oh oh oh oh 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
I don't know, I don't know what caused, I don't know what caused me to be this way 
I don't know, I don't know but I probably be this way 'til my dying day 
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold beat bangs, I don't need to say 
I guess this is how you made me

Oooh! Ladies and gentlemen, the moment you've all been waiting for
In this corner, weighing 175 pounds, with a record of 17 rapes
400 assaults, and 4 murders, the undisputed, most diabolical
Villain in the world, Slim Shady!

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
Ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ok, let's go
Back when Andre, the giant, mister elephant tusk
Picture us, you'll just be another one bit the dust
Just one up my mother's son who got thrown under the bus



Kiss my butt, lick my wonder cheese from under my nuts
It disgusts me to see the game the way that it looks
It's a must, I redeem my name and haters get mushed
Bitches lust, man they love me when I'm laying the cut
Missed the cut, the lady give a eighty some paper cut

Now picture us, it's ridiculous you curse at the thought
Cuz when I spit the verse the shit gets worse than Worcestershire sauce
If I could fit the words as picture perfect, works every time
Every verse, every line, as simple as nursery rhymes
It's elementary, the elephants have entered the room
I venture to say with the center of attention its true
Not to mention back with a vengeance and hit the signal
Of the bat symbol, the platinum trio is back on you hoes

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us and my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

Ladies and gentlemen, Dr. Dre

They see that low rider go by they're like "Oh my!"
You ain't got to tell me why you're sick cuz I know why
I dip through in that six trey like sick 'em Dre
I'm an itch that they can't scratch, they're sick of me
But hey, what else can I say? I love LA
Cuz over and above all, it's just another day
And this one begins where the last one ends
Pick up where we left off and get smashed again

I'll be dammed, just fucked around and crashed my Benz
Driving around with a smashed front end
Let's cash that one in
Grab another one from out the stable
The Monte Carlo, El Camino or the El Dorado
The hell if I know
Do I want leather seats or vinyl?
Decisions, decisions, garage looks like Precision Collision
Or Maico beats quake like Waco
Just keep the bass low, speakers away from your face though

So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

And I take great pleasure in introducing, 50 Cent

It's bottle after bottle
The money ain't a thang when you party with me
Its what we into, it's simple
We ball out of control like you wouldn't believe
I'm the napalm, the bomb, the Don, I'm King Kong
Get rolled on, wrapped up and reigned on
I'm so calm through Vietnam, ring the alarm
Bring the Chandon, burn marajauan do what you want

Nigga on and on till the break of what
Get the paper man I'm caking you know I don't give a fuck
I spend it like it don't mean nothing
Blow it like its supposed to be blown
Motherfucker I'm grown
I stunt I style I flash the shit
I gets what the fuck I want, so what I trick?
Fat ass burgundy bags, classy shit
Jimmy Cho shoes I say move a bitch move


So crack a bottle, let your body waddle
Don't act like a snobby model
You just hit the lotto
Uh oh uh oh, bitches hopping in my Tahoe
Got one riding shotgun and no not one of them got gloves

Now where's the rubbers? Who's got the rubbers?
I noticed there's so many of them and there's really not that many of us
And ladies love us, my posse's kicking up dust
It's on till the break of dawn and we're starting this party from dusk

[Eminem:] 
Feels like a close, it's coming to 
Fuck am I gonna do? 
It's too late to start over 
This is the only thing I, thing I know 

[Eminem:] 
Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is 
Find different ways to word the same, old song 
Ever since I came along 
From the day the song called "Hi! My Name Is" dropped 
Started thinking my name was fault 
Cause any time things went wrong
I was the one who they would blame it on 
The media made me the equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan 
Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dog 
Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls 
Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft 
And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws 
And the fangs been out since then 



But up until the instant that I've went against it 
It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought 
No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught 
Do I really belong in this game? I pondered 
I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not? 
So back and forth in my brain, the tug of war wages on 
And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon 
But sometimes you gotta take a loss 
And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off 
And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet 
And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it 
Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah 
Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times 
How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme? 
What I really wanna say is if there's anyone else that can relate to my story 
Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are 
When I was afraid to… 

[Sia:] 
I was a... 
Afraid to make a single sound 
Afraid I will never find a way out 
Afraid I'd never be found 
I don't wanna go another round 
An angry man's power will shut you up 
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love 
Run out of excuses for everyone 
So here I am and I will not run 
Guts over fear (the time is near) 
Guts over fear (I shed a tear) 
For all the times I let you push me around 
And let you keep me down 
Now I got guts over fear, guts over fear 

[Eminem:] 
Feels like a close, it's coming to 
Fuck am I gonna do? 
It's too late to start over 
This is the only thing I, thing I know 

[Eminem:] 
I know what it's like, I was there once, single parents 
Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world? 
And the pain spawns all the anger on 
But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on 
That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit 
Learned how to harness it while the reins were off 
And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part 
Was soon as I stopped saying "I gave a fuck" 
Haters started to appreciate my art
And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused 
But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone? 
And the lights go out in that trailer park? 
And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows 
And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from 
Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun 
So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song 
But I'd rather make "Not Afraid 2" than make another motherfucking "We Made You", uh 
Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs 
My demise and my uprise, pray to God 
I just opened enough eyes later on
Gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong 
Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt 
Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt 
Just having to balance my dang self 
When on eggshells I was made to walk 
But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the 
Strength to cause Shady-mania, 
So when they empty that stadium 
At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done 
So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted 
I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song 
And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more 
From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk 
Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off 
The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone 
And to think I was... gone 

[Sia:] 
I was a... 
Afraid to make a single sound 
Afraid I will never find a way o-o-out 
Afraid I'd never be found 
I don't wanna go another round 
An angry man's power will shut you up 
Trip wires fill this house with tip-toed love 
Run out of excuses for everyone 
So here I am and I will not run 
Guts over fear (the time is near) 
Guts over fear (I shed a tear) 
For all the times I let you push me around 
And let you keep me down 
Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear 


Mom, I know I let you down 
And though you say the days are happy 
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up? 
And mom, I know he's not around 
But don't you place the blame on me 
As you pour yourself another drink 

I guess we are who we are 
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on 
Maybe we took this too far 

I went in headfirst 
Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse 
My mom probably got it the worst 
The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are 
Did I take it too far? 
Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs 
But regardless I don't hate you cause ma! 
You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom 
Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam 



Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb
Equivalent to Chemical warfare 
And forever we can drag this on and on 
But, agree to disagree 
That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me 
You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve 
(little prick just leave) ma, let me grab my fucking coat 
Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each others throats? 
Especially when dad, he fucked us both 
We're in the same fucking boat 
You'd think that it'd make us close (nope) 
Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine 
A car full of belongings 
Still got a ways to go, back 
To grandma's 
House it's straight up the road 
And I was the man of the house, the oldest 
So my shoulders carried the weight 
Of the load 
Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and 
That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changable 
And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but

I guess we are who we are 
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on 
Maybe we took this too far 

Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though 
Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth 
But I'm sorry mama for Cleaning Out My Closet, at the time I was angry 
Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, cause 
Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes 
That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio 
And I think of Nathan being placed in a home 
And all the medicine you fed us 
And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but 
Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow 
And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though 
But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo 
All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both 
Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours 
But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, cause 
One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was 
Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address 
But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus 
Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas 
Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's 
If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them 
And although one has met their grandma 
Once you pulled up in our drive one nights 
As we were leaving to get some hamburgers 
Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you 
And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me 
As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and 
I saw your headlights as I looked back 
And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad 
So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet 
I guess I had to get this off my chest 
I hope I get the chance to lay it before I'm dead 
The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing 
So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you this message 
That I'll always love you from afar, cause you're my mama... 

I guess we are who we are 
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on 
Maybe we took this too far 

I want a new life 
One without a cause 
So I'm coming home tonight 
Well 
No matter what the cost 
And if the plane goes down 
And if the crew can't wake me up 
Just know that I was alright 
And I was not afraid to die 
Even if there's songs to sing 
My children will carry me 
Just know that I'm 
Alright 
I was not afraid to die 
Because I put my faith in my new girl 
So I never say goodbye cruel world
Just know that I'm alright 
I am not 
Afraid to die 

I guess we are who we are 
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on 
Maybe we took this too far

can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars 
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now 
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars 
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now 
and it seems like yesterday it was just a dream 
but those days are gone they're just memories 
and it seems like yesterday it was just a dream 
but those days are gone 

Alright, 
lets pretend, marshall mathers never picked up a pen 
lets pretend, things woulda been no different 
pretend he procrastinated and had no motivation 
pretend he just made excuses that were so paper thin 
they could blow away with the wind 
marshall youre never gonna make it 
makes no sense to play the game 
there aint no way that you'll win 
pretend he'd just stay outside all day 
and play with his friends 



pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend 
and it wasnt time to move and schools werent changing again 
he wasnt socially akward and just strange as a kid 
he had a father and his mother wasnt crazy as shit 
and he never dreamed he could rip stadiums 
and just lazy as shit 
fuck a talent show in the gymnasium, bitch 
you wont amount to shit, quit day dreaming, kid 
you need to get your cranium checked 
you're thinking like an alien, it just aint realistic 
now pretend things just make him angry with this shit 
and there was no one he could even aim when he's pissed 
and his alarm went off to wake him but he didnt make it to the rap olympics 
left to his plane and he missed it 
he's gonna have a hard time explaining to hailey and lainey 
these food stamps and this weak shit 
cause he never risked shit, he hoped and he wished it 
but it didnt fall on his lap so he aint even here 
he pretends that .. 

can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars 
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now 
can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shooting stars 
i could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now




Look, if you had one shot, one opportunity 
To seize everything you ever wantedâ€à‚Â¦One moment 
Would you capture it or just let it slip? 

His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy 
There's vomit on his sweater already, mom's spaghetti 
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready 
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting 
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud 
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out 
He's chokin, how everybody's jokin now 
The clock's run out, time's up over, bloah! 
Snap back to reality, Oh there goes gravity 
Oh, there goes Rabbit, he choked 
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy 
Is he? No 
He won't have it , he knows his whole back city's ropes 
It don't matter, he's dope 



He knows that, but he's broke 
He's so stacked that he knows 
When he goes back to his mobile home, that's when it's 
Back to the lab again yo 
This whole rap shit 
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him 

Chorus X2 

You better lose yourself in the music, the moment 
You own it, you better never let it go 
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime yo 

The soul's escaping, through this hole that it's gaping 
This world is mine for the taking 
Make me king, as we move toward a, new world order 
A normal life is borin, but superstardom's close to post mortar 
It only grows harder, only grows hotter 
He blows its all over, these hoes is all on him 
Coast to coast shows, he's know as the globetrotter 
Lonely roads, God only knows 
He's grown farther from home, he's no father 
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter 
But hold your nose cuz here goes the cold water 
These ho's don't want him no mo, he's cold product 
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows 
He nose dove and sold nada 
So the soap opera is told and unfolds 
I suppose it's old potna, but the beat goes on 
Da da dum da dum da da 

Chorus X2 

No more games, I'ma change what you call rage 
Tear this mothafuckin roof off like 2 dogs caged 
I was playin in the beginnin, the mood all changed 
I been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage 
But I kept rhymin and stepwritin the next cypher 
Best believe somebody's payin the pied piper 
All the pain inside amplified by the fact 
That I can't get by with my 9 to 5 
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 
Cuz man, these goddam food stamps don't buy diapers 
And it's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life 
And these times are so hard and it's getting even harder 
Tryin to feed and water my seed, plus 
Teeter totter, caught up between bein a father and a prima donna 
Baby mama drama's screamin on and 
Too much for me to wanna 
Stay in one spot, another day of monotomy 
Has gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail 
I've got to formulate a plot fore I end up in jail or shot 
Success is my only mothafuckin option, failure's not 
Mom, I love you, but this trailer has got to go 
I cannot grow old in Salem's lot 
So here I go is my shot. 
Feet fail me not cuz maybe the only opportunity that I got 

Chorus X2 

You can do anything you set your mind to, man 




[Rihanna] 
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, 
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts. 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, 
But thats alright because I love the way you lie, 
I love the way you lie. 

[Eminem] 
I can’t tell you what it really is, 
I can only tell you what it feels like, 
and right now its a steel knife in my windpipe 
I can’t breath when I still fight well I can fight 
As long as the wrong feels right its like I’m in flight 
High off of love, Drunk from my hate, 
Its like I’m huffing paint and I love it the more I suffer. 
I suffocate and right before I’m about to drown, 
She resuscitates me, She fucking hates me and I love it 
Wait! Where you going? I’m leaving you 
No you ain’t, Come back 
Were running right back, Here we going again 



Its so insane cus’ when its going it good, 
It’s going great, I’m Superman with the wind in his back 
She’s Lois Lane, but when its bad its awful 
I feel so ashamed, I snap. Who’s that dude? 
I don’t even know his name, I laid hands on her 
I never stoop so low again, I guess I don’t know my own strength. 

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, 
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts. 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, 
But thats alright because I love the way you lie, 
I love the way you lie. 
I love the way you lie. 

[Eminem] 
You ever love somebody so much that you could barely breath when your with em’? 
And you meet and neither one, even know what hit em’ 
You got the warm fuzzy feelin’, ya them chills used to get em’ 
Now your gettin’ fuckin’ sick of lookin’ at em’ 
You swore you would never hit em’, 
Never do nothin’ to her now your in each others face, spewing venom in your words when you spit em’ 
You both pull each others hair, scratch, clob, hit em’, throw em’ down, pin em’ 
So lost in your moment when your in em’ 
Its the rage thats the culprit, It chokes you both 
So they say you best go your separate ways, 
Guess that they don’t know you, because today 
That was yesterday, Yesterday is over 
Its a different day, Sounds like broken records playin’ over 
But you promised her, Next time you’ll show her restraint 
You don’t get another chance, Life is not a Nintendo game 
But you lied again, and now you get to watch her leave out the window, 
Guess thats why they call it window pane (pain) 

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, 
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts. 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, 
But thats alright because I love the way you lie, 
I love the way you lie. 
I love the way you lie. 

[Eminem] 
Now I know we said things, Did things 
That we didn’t mean and we fall back into the same pattern 
Seventeen, but your temper is just as bad as mine is 
Your the same as me, but when he comes to love ya 
its just blinded, Baby, Please come back, 
It wasn’t you, Baby, It was me 
Maybe our relationships isn’t as crazy as it seems 
Maybe thats what happens when a Tornado meets a Volcano, 
All I know I love you too much to walk and Wait up! 
Come Inside, pick up the bags up the sidewalk, 
Don’t you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk, 
Told you this was my fault, look me in the eyeball, 
Next time I’m pissed I’ll lay my fist at the dry wall, 
Next time, there wont be no next time, 
I apologize even though I know its lies, 
I’m tired of the games, I just want her back, 
I know I’m a liar, If she ever tries to fuckin’ leave again, 
I’m a tie her to the bed and set this house on fire, 
Just gonna… 

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn, 
But thats alright because I like the way it hurts. 
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry, 
But thats alright because I love the way you lie, 
I love the way you lie. 
I love the way you lie.

Yeah 
I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now 
But hey, what daddy always tell you? 
Straighten up little soldier 
Stiffen up that upper lip 
What you crying about? 
You got me 

Hailie I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad 
Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had 
I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh 
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry 
Cuz you're scared, I ain't there? 
Daddy's with you in your prayers 
No more crying, wipe them tears 
Daddy's here, no more nightmares 
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it 
Laney uncles crazy, aint he? 
Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it 
We're all we got in this world 



When it spins, when it swirls 
When it whirls, when it twirls 
Two little beautiful girls 
Lookin' puzzled, in a daze 
I know it's confusing you 
Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news 
I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems 
The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me 
All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see 
Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did 
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me 
But things have gotten so bad between us 
I don't see us ever being together ever again 
Like we used to be when we was teenagers 
But then of course everything always happens for a reason 
I guess it was never meant to be 
But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is 
But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep 
Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream 

[Chorus] 
Now hush little baby, don't you cry
Everything's gonna be alright 
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, i told ya 
Daddy's here to hold ya through the night 
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why 
We feel how we feel inside 
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby 
But i promise momma's gon' be alright 

It's funny 
I remember back one year when daddy had no money 
Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up 
And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me 
Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em 
I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying 
Cuz daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job 
But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom 
And at the time every house that we lived in 
Either kept getting broke into and robbed 
Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar 
Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college 
Almost had a thousand dollars till someone broke in and stole it 
And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart 
And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart 
Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back 
On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment 
And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara 
And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre 
And flew you and momma out to see me 
But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me 
Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it 
And you and Laney were to young to understand it 
Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit 
And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it 
I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 
Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud 
Now I'm sittin in this empty house, just reminiscing 
Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out 
To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now 
Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here 
Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here 
I like the sound of that, yeah 
It's got a ring to it don't it? 
Shh, momma's only gone for the moment 

[Chorus] 

And if you ask me too 
Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird 
I'mma give you the world 
I'mma buy a diamond ring for you 
I'mma sing for you 
I'll do anything for you to see you smile 
And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine 
I'mma break that birdies neck 
I'd go back to the jewler who sold it to ya 
And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (haha)


Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?) 
My name is.. tiki tiki Slim Shady 
Hi! My name is.. (huh?) My name is.. (what?) 
My name is.. tiki tiki Slim Shady 

Ahem.. excuse me! 
Can I have the attention of the class 
for one second? 

[Eminem] 
Hi kids! Do you like violence? (Yeah yeah yeah!) 
Wanna see me stick Nine Inch Nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh!) 
Wanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah yeah!) 
Try 'cid and get fucked up worse then my life is? (Huh?) 
My brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight 
but I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Ummmm..) 
And Dr. Dre said, "Slim Shady you a basehead!" 
Uh-uhhh! "So why's your face red? Man you wasted!" 
Well since age twelve, I've felt like I'm someone else 



Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt 
Got pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off 
And smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross 
I smoke a fat pound of grass and fall on my ass 
faster than the fat bitch who sat down too fast 
C'mere slut! (Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dog!) 
I don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off! 

Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?) 
My name is.. tiki tiki Slim Shady 
Hi! My name is.. (huh?) My name is.. (what?) 
My name is.. tiki tiki Slim Shady 

[Eminem] 
My English teacher wanted to fuck me in junior high 
the only problem was, my english teacher was a guy. 
I smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler 
and stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Owwwwwwww!) 
Walked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up 
Flashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup 
Extraterrestrial, killin pedestrians 
Rapin lesbians while they screamin:: "LET'S JUST BE FRIENDS!" 
Ninety-nine percent of my life I was lied to 
I just found out my mom does more dope than I do 
I told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper 
Make a record about doin drugs and name it after her (Oh thank you!) 
You know you blew up when the women rush the stands 
and try to touch your hands like some screamin Usher fans (Aaahhhhhh!) 
This guy at White Castle asked for my autograph 
(Dude, can I get your autograph?) 
So I signed it: 'Dear Dave, thanks for the support, ASSHOLE!' 

Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?) 
My name is.. tiki tiki Slim Shady 
Hi! My name is.. (huh?) My name is.. (what?) 
My name is.. tiki tiki Slim Shady 

[Eminem] 
Stop the tape! This kid needs to be locked away! (Get him!) 
Dr. Dre, don't just stand there, OPERATE! 
I'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die 
I'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive 
Am I comin or goin? I can barely decide 
I just drank a fifth of vodka -- dare me to drive? (Go ahead) 
All my life I was very deprived 
I ain't had a woman in years, and my palms are too hairy to hide 
(Whoops!) Clothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk (hachhh-too) 
I spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (C'mere) 
When I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits 
HOW YOU GONNA BREAST FEED ME MOM? (WAH!) 
YOU AIN'T GOT NO TITS! (WAHHH!) 
I lay awake and strap myself in the bed 
Put a bulleproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (BANG!) 
I'm steamin mad (Arrrggghhh!) 
And by the way when you see my dad? (Yeah?) 
Tell him that I slit his throat, in this dream I had 

Hi! My name is.. (what?) My name is.. (who?) 
My name is.. tiki tiki Slim Shady 
Hi! My name is.. (huh?) My name is.. (what?) 
My name is.. tiki tiki Slim Shady 





I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
(Yeah, it's been a ride)
Everybody, everybody
(I guess I had to)
Come take my hand, come take my hand
(Go to that place to get to this one)
We'll walk this world together through the storm
(Now some of you)
Whatever weather, cold or warm
(Might still be in that place)
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
(If you're tryin' to get out)
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
(Just follow me, I'll get you there)
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay 'em
But you won't take the sting out these words before I say 'em
'Cause ain't no way I'ma let you stop me from causing mayhem
When I say I'ma do something, I do it, I don't give a damn what you think
I'm doin' this for me, so fuck the world



Feed it beans, it's gassed up if it thinks it's stopping me
I'ma be what I set out to be, without a doubt, undoubtably
And all those who look down on me, I'm tearing down your balcony
No if, ands, or buts, don't try to ask him why or how can he
From "Infinite" down to that last "Relapse" album
He's still shittin' whether he's on salary, paid hourly
Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
Whichever comes first, for better or worse
He's married to the game, like a fuck-you for Christmas
His gift is a curse, forget the earth, he's got
The urge to pull his dick from the dirt and fuck the whole universe
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this route together through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
Okay, quit playin' with the scissors and shit and cut the crap
I shouldn't have to rhyme these words in a rhythm for you to know it's a rap
You said you was the king, you lied through your teeth
For that fuck your fillings, instead of getting crowned you're getting capped
And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact
Let's be honest, that last "Relapse" CD, was "eh"
Perhaps I ran the max and since hit the ground
Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now
All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click clack, pow
'Cause I ain't playin' around, it's the game called circlin'
I don't know how, I'm way too rough to back down
But I think I'm still tryin' to figure this crap out
Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't
This fucking black cloud still follows me around
But it's time to exorcise these demons, these motherfuckers are doing jumping-jacks now
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this route together through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road
And I just can't keep living this way
So starting today, I'm breaking out of this cage
I'm standing up, I'ma face my demons
I'm manning up, I'ma hold my ground
I've had enough, now I'm so fed up
Tryin' to put my life back together right now
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me
Admittedly, I probably did it subliminally for you
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through
And don't even realize what you did, believe me you
I've been through the ringer, but take it through little to the middle finger
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of
My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers
And drop dead, no more beef flingers
No more drama, from now on I promise to only focus
On handlin' my responsibilities as a father
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it
'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquour counter up
'Cause I'm raisin' the bar, I shoot for the moon
But I'm too busy gazin' at stars I feel amazin'
And I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
To take a stand, to take a stand
Everybody, everybody
Come take my hand, come take my hand
We'll walk this route together through the storm
Whatever weather, cold or warm
Just lettin' you know that you're not alone
Holla if you feel like you've been down the same road

I am phenomenal 
With every ounce of my blood 
With every breath in my lungs 
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal 
I am phenomenal 
However long that it takes 
I'll go to whatever rates 
It's gonna make me a monster though 
I am phenomenal 
But I would never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’ 
Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal 

Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles 
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll 
Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em 
When the going got rough 
Show ‘em what I done thought that was the worse, little sissy 
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere? 
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse 
The messiest thing you've ever gone through is your purse 



Yeah, I don't try like Captain, I might as well 
Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve 
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall 
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself 
Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself 
Inside the realm where the unknown and boldly go 
In the waters where nobody else has gone before 
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so 
Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant 
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am... 

I am phenomenal 
With every ounce of my blood 
With every breath in my lungs 
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal 
I am phenomenal 
However long that it takes 
I'll go to whatever rates 
It's gonna make me a monster though 
I am phenomenal 
But I would never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’ 
Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal 

Let me self-empower you 
When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you 
When you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel 
I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel 
Convert it to gunpowder too 
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid 
Put a spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing 
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it 
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it 
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you raise 
Never take back what you say 
If you stay trapped in your brain, engage in this fueled cage match 
Ready to scrap asap 
Take your fists to his bones 
Show Biggie who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace 
Yeah I picture 'em all as plastic and foam 
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at 
And set it off like a placemat 
(I am phenomenal) 
And I want you to say that 

I am phenomenal 
With every ounce of my blood 
With every breath in my lungs 
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal 
I am phenomenal 
However long that it takes 
I'll go to whatever rates 
It's gonna make me a monster though 
I am phenomenal 
But I would never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’ 
Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal 

Said I need you to make a note 
And find yourself, your glory, free your person 

Is that a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-up valve? 
Can't even cut the power to it, when it's what allowed 
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground 
Cause I worked my butt off now 
It's a subject I don't know how to shut up about 
Cause I stuck it out 
Like a mothafuckin' tongue to tie, I responded when I got shoved around 
You're gonna have down believers 
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how 
Get it how you live 
But are you prepared to give more than you get? 
And put in twice what you get back from this shit 
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give 
Rap is my shift 
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield, I'ma knife this will 
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill 
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt 
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb 
Ready to face it, each challenge waitin' 
Taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation 
Look what I have built, reputation is delegation 
The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing 
Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement 
An accusation... I am legendary status, in fact 
That is the only way you'll ever be able to say 
Your legend is makin' an allegation 
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with 
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath 
Managed to prove who the best man is 
Surveil it, all cards be the only ones left standing 
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage 
Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw 
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed 

I am phenomenal 
With every ounce of my blood 
With every breath in my lungs 
Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal 
I am phenomenal 
However long that it takes 
I'll go to whatever rates 
It's gonna make me a monster though 
I am phenomenal 
But I would never say, ‘Oh, it’s impossible’ 
Cause I'm gonna be phenomenal 



So, Just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick 
It's also Richard cause I feel like you should 
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it 
I said just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick 
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick 
When I hold my privates to your first clue, Sherlock, prick! 

And I would like to introduce myse-self, surprise! Hi, it's Ike 
'bout to get my Ike on I come with a life supply of wife beaters 
And my Nikes on and a white tee over that iron mic 
Lookin' fly tonight, feel like I might die from a spider bite 
Come back as Spider-Man, park my Peter inside a dyke 
Bitch actin' like she got fuckin' higher standards than Meijer's, right 
Had to pry her fingers off the mothafuckin' Breyer's ice cream 
With the pliers, like "Ahh!" only a ruthless bastard would do this 
Take a toothless bitch with no taste buds to Ruth's Chris 
Give her toothpicks, stop on the way home, pick up two Big Bufords
Scrupulous, girl, you got a nice pair, but you're plumb stupid! 
So when I pull up in that Benz, don't try to pretend you ain't interested 
To impress your stupid ass friends and refuse to get in woman 



And get slammed on the ground and snap like a pool stick against cement 
If you sick of dick, pretend it's a musical instrument 
You get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow 
I can tell at first glance you're a ho cause your pants are so tight 
When you dance with O. Trice, your implants explode 
So cold to dykes, the chance is snow in San Francisco 
Boy I'm from Detroit city, you live in animosity 
That's a fucked up state to be in, such an atrocity 
Look where these random thoughts get me in senseless mind babble 
"What me? Apologize?" That's just the way the rhyme unravels 
And I wouldn't fucking take it back if I time traveled! 

So, Just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick 
It's also Richard cause I feel like you should 
Pry your fucking mouth up off of it 
I said just call me Richard, cause I'm a dick 
You ain't gotta be no detective to figure out I'm a dick 
When I hold my privates to your first clue, Sherlock, prick! 
Just call me Richard


Verse #1 
These ideas are, nightmares to white parents, 
whose worst fear is a child with dyed hair and who likes earrings. 
Like whatever they say has no bearing, 
its so scary in a house that allows, no swearing. 
To see him walking around with his, headphones blaring 
Alone in his own zone,cold, and he dont care. 
He's a problem child,and what bothers him all comes out, 
when he talks about, his fuckin' dad walkin out. 
Causes he hates him so bad that he, blocks him out. 
And if he ever saw him again he'd probobly knock him out. 
His thoughts are whacked, he's mad so he's talkin' back, 
talkin black, brainwashed from rock and rap. 
He sags his pants, do-rags and a stocking cap. 
His step-father hit him so he, socked him back. 
And broke his nose, this house is a broken home, 
there's no control, he just lets his emotions go! 
Come on... Chorus: 
Sing with me, sing for the year 
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear 



Sing with me,just for today 
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away Verse #2 
Entertainment is changing, intertwine it with gansters. 
In the land of the killers, a sinner's mind is a sanctum 
Holy or unholy, only have one homie, 
only this gun, lonely, cause so many don't know me. 
Then everybody just feels like they can relate. 
I guess words are a motherfucker, they can be great. 
Or they can be degrate, or even worse they can teach hate. 
Its like kids hang on every single statement we make 
like they worship us. Plus all the stores ship us platinum. 
Now how the fuck did this metamorphasis happen? 
From standin' on corners and porches just rappin'. 
To havin' a fortune, no more kissin' ass. 
But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you, 
fans turn on you, eterneys all wanna turn at you. 
To get their hands on every dime you have. 
They want you to lose your mind every time you mad. 
So they can try to make you out to look like a loose canon. 
Any dispute, dont hesitate to produce hand-guns. 
Thats why these prosecutors wanna convict me. 
Strictly just to get me offa these streets quickly. 
But all their kids been listen'n to me religiously, 
so i'm signing cds while police fingerprint me. 
They're for the judges daughter, but his grudge is against me. 
If i'm such a fuckin' menace, this shit doesnt make sense,B. 
It's all political, if my music is literal and i'm a criminal, 
then how the fuck can i raise a little girl? 
I couldn't.I wouldn't be fit to. 
You're full of shit too, Gurrera, that was a fist that hit you! ChorusVerse #3 
They say music can alter moods and talk to you. 
But can it load a gun up for you and cock it too? 
Well if it can, then the next time you assault a dude, 
just tell the judge it was my fault, and i'll get sued. 
See what these kids do is, hear about us toting pistols 
and, they want to get one cause, they think the shit's cool. 
Not knowin' we're really just protectin' ourselves, 
we entertainers, of course this shit's affecting our sales 
you ignoranous. But music is reflection of self. 
We just explain it, and then we get our cheques in the mail 
it's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothin', 
to bein' able to have any fuckin' thing that we wanted. 
It's why we sing for these kids that don't have a thing. 
Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine. 
Who post pinup pictures on their walls all day long. 
Idolise their favourite rappers and know all they songs. 
Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives, 
till they sit and they cry at night, wishing they die. 
Till they throw on a rap record, and they sit and they vibe. 
We're nothing to you, but we're the fuckin' shit in they eyes. 
That's why we, sieze the moment, and try to freeze it and own it, 
squeeze it and hold it, 'cos we consider these minutes golden. 
And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone,and 
just let our spirits live on, through lyrics that you hear in our songs, 
and we can: ChorusChorus Without BeatInstrumental
