Now this shit's about to kick off, this party looks wack 
Let's take it back to straight hip-hop and start it from scratch 
I'm 'bout to bloody this track up, everybody get back 
That's why my pen needs a pad cause my rhymes on the ra-hag 
Just like I did with addiction I'm 'bout to kick it 
Like a magician, critics I turn to crickets 
Got 'em still on the fence ready to pick it 
But quick get impaled when I tell 'em stick it 
So sick I'm looking pale, well that's my pigment 
'bout to go ham, ya bish, shout out to Kendrick 
Let's bring it back to that vintage Slim, bitch! 
The art of the MCing mixed with da Vinci and MC Ren 
And I don't mean Stimpy's friend, bitch 
Been public enemy since you thought PE was gym, bitch 

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long 
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down 
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m. 



So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go 
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket 
Life's too short to not go for broke 
So everybody, everybody, shake your body 

Guess it's just the way that I'm dressed, ain't it? 
Khakis pressed, Nike shoes crispy and fresh laced 
So I guess it ain't 
Dead after shave of cologne that made him just faint 
Plus I just showed up with a coat fresher than wet paint 
So if love is a chess game, check mate 
But girl your body's banging, jump me in, bang -- bang, bang 
Yessiree Bob I was thinking the same thing 
So come get on this kids rock, baw wit da baw, bang bang 
P-p-p-pow pow chicka wow wow 
Catch a cab, I wanna go down, br-bow-bow 
Slow it down, throw in the towel, t-t-towel towel 
Dumb it down, I don't know how, how, how, how 
At least I know that I don't know 
Question is are you bozos smart enough to feel stupid 
Hope so, now ho... 

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long 
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down 
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m. 
So crank the bass up like crazy and let yourself go, let yourself go 
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket 
Life's too short to not go for broke 
So everybody, everybody, get your vials 

They say that love is powerful as cough syrup and Styrofoam 
All I know is I fell asleep and woke up in that Monte Carlo 
With the ugly Kardashian 
Lamar, oh sorry yo, we done both set the bar low 
Bars hard, drugs hard thought that's the past 
But I done did enough codeine to knock Future into tomorrow 
And girl I ain't got no money to borrow 
But I am tryin' to find a way to get you alone, car note! 
Oh, Marshall Mathers shouldn’t everybody know 
Get the bar soap lathered, came ghost and called Arthur’s Cargo's 
Girl you’re fixin' to get your heart broke, don’t be absurd man 
You bird brained baby I ain’t called anybody baby since Birdman 
Unless you’re a swallow 
Word, w-word man you heard, but don’t be discouraged girl 
This is your jam, unless you got toe jam 

Take your shoes off, let your hair down and (go berserk), all night long 
Grow your beard out, just weird out and (go berserk), all night long

We're gonna rock this house until we knock it down 
So turn the volume loud, cause it's mayhem 'til the a.m. 
So baby make just like K-Fed and let yourself go, let yourself go 
Say fuck it before we kick the bucket 
Life's too short to not go for broke 
So everybody, everybody, shake your body

Jumped out of the second floor of a record store... 
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder 
In Ecuador with Edward Norton 
Eminem speaks out against Donald Trump on "Campaign Speech" 
Witness the metamorphosis 
Of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman 
From the Hessian War and 
Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman 
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan 
Endless sores and reservoir 
Of extension cords in dresser drawers 
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors 
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin 
Excellent boyfriend 
Use intercourse to settle scores 
With women who have been vendettas towards men 
Dickhead is forced in and the shredded foreskin 
Red is torn and they're only bein' fed a portion 
Bed sores in sore shins 
Pregnant whores can get abortions



Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption 
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor 
A predator, I'm headed for competitors 
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals 
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store 
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus 
Yes, of course, I mess up once 
You want some? Come and get some, boys! 
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course 
On excessive force and pressure points 
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange 
Dress and four inch heels to address the court 
With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso 
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him 
In my present form I'm Desert Storm 
Appetite for destruction is no suppressant for 
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel 
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous! 
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus 
Met a contortionist, said, "When you wanna get sexual?" 
She said, "However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible." 
Expired tags on the Saturn, got Catherine Bach 
In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on 
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph 
For this asshole cop's daughter 
Laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it 
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock 
Had a heart attack and dropped dead 
Started fallin' back with it 
And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock 
One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch 
Crack for an axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff, pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel 
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound* 
Asked if they had a laugh in stock 
That was fuckin' stupid… 
You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch 
A doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic 
Bitch, get to massagin' this dick! 
Like spas in this bitch, slob on it, with gobs of lipstick 
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with 
It's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with 
She's non-existent 
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some swab and slick shit 
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches 
Misfit, blond and nitwit 
Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit 
Screamed, "I hate blondes," and became one, I'm optimistic 
Love to start shit 
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment 
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx 
I'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble 'cause a double cross 
The shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across 
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults 
A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer 
Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's is 
Something's awful when Dustin Hoffman's 
Dressin' up in your mummy costume 
On stage dancin' to "Brain Damage", what's the problem? 
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status 
Run the faucet, I'ma dunk 
A bunch of Trump supporters underwater 
Snuck up on 'em in Ray Bans in a gray van with a spray tan 
It's a wrap, like an Ace bandage 
Don't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last DNA strand 
E&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand 
She wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan 
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say 
Consider me a dangerous man 
But you should be afraid of this dang candidate 
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet 
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin' 
And that's what you wanted 
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button, who doesn't have to answer to no one – great idea! 
If I was president, gettin' off is 
The first order of business once I get in office 
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam 
Naked, laughing, dick cupped in hand 
Screaming, "Fuck safe sex!" 
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him 
Tell Congress I run this land 
And I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy 
Addiction to friction and static 
Addict who can't escape the habit 
It's in you to chase the dragon 
But as fate would have it, I walked up in major Magics 
Dressed as the maintenance man 
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket, with a gauge to blast it 
And sped away in the station wagon 
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's
Crazy asses in the backseat 
Throwin' Stay-Free pads at me 
Dead passenger in the passenger seat 
Unfasten the safety latches 
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard 
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires 
Finna get a murder case and catch it 
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic 
And send Dylan Roof through the windshield of the Benz 
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'... 
Like a windmill with a thin bill while his skin's peelin' 
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar 
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder 
Knock it into the upper peninsula 
You want to go against zilla? The Rap God 
When will I quit? Never been realer 
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt 
Whose pens iller than Prince in a chinchilla 
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer of bin syllable binge 
Fill a syringe, till I 
Draw first blood 
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular 
Couldn't be more awkwarder 
Cause you're innocence I robbed you of 
It's my fingers that got stuck up 
Tortured a, not give a 
Slapstick, hockey puck 
The broad hunter with the sawed off 
Like an arm when it's lopped off of ya 
But I'm not gonna, get the shotgun
Or the Glock, I'm gonna opt for the ox 
Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I sharpen 
It's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker 
The rock cuts into rock cause who would have thought 
This much of a cocksucker that go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter 
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned 
I'm unrevealing quickly 
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me 
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey 
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles 
Like what happened to Chris Reeves' spine column 
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems 
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em 
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles 
And why I had to come back on these faggots who diss me is 
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel 
But my patience is wearing thin 
Swear I been contemplating rubbing shit in your face till I smear it in 
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen 
And never appear again 
If you actually had fucking careers to end 
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them 
Molly, I'm gone off you 
Man, light some kush 
You're my first take, I'll nail you 
Can't lie, I gush 
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize 
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push 
You can get it in a can like some Anheuser Busch 
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush 
Mushed against your damn side, you puss 
And thighs are squooshed 
What kind of attires that? 
I'm ready to be rode 
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it popping like a flat 
Light the match to ignite the wrath 
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half 
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me 
Like a scab 
Hard to describe in fact 
Startling violent perhaps 
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that 
And you aren't really surprised at that 
But as far as these lines I rap 
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69'ed the track 
(Why am I such a dick!?)

Yeah, 
You know technically, Im not even really supposed to be here right now, 
So fuck it, might as well make the most of it. 

Ahh ah ah ah eh eh eh eh ehhh 

Yeah, haha 
Feels good, 
Whooo, 
Guess I'm lucky, 
Some of us don't get a second chance. 
But I aint blowing this one. 
Naw man, haha, 
Shit I feel like I can do anything now. 

Who can catch lightning in the bottle, set fire to water, 
Commin out the nozzle on the fire hose, flyer than swatters 

Cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man. 




Smash an hour glass, grab the sand, take his hands an cup 'em, 
Spit a rhyme to freeze the clock, take the hands of time an cuff em. 

Cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man. 

Theres a storm commin that the weather man couldn't predict, 
I start the bug prick, you better flee cause I get ticked 
Its a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked 
I got up I'm back to punch ya to the ground, ya trick, 
Its a trap, fuck my last cd this shits in my trash, 
I be god damned if another rapper gets in my ass, 
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if its my last. 
You can die in the blink of an eye, so bat ya eyelashes, 

and keep winking and blown kisses cuz your flirting with death 
Im destroying your livelihood, I aint just hurting your rep, 
I catch a flow and get goin, 
No remorse, I'm showinn they slowin, for no one, 
Knowin there is nothing you can do about it 
Zeroin on the target like a marksman, 
The target is you, 
I shut ya lane down, 
Took ya spot, parked in it too, 
Watchin it flow, lighter fluid, saliva what can ya do, 
Go get ya crew to hype ya up stand behind you like whoooo! 

That boys hot enough to melt hell burn satan too, 
Fry his ass, and put his ashes back together with glue, 
See you can hate em, he don't blame you frankly he would too, 
This game couldn't afford to lose him, how bout you? 

Now guess who who (hey), 
Heres a clue (hey),

Send the fellow Shady dang came to wrap the game up in cellophane, 
Raise hell from hell he came, 
But didn't come to bore you with the cinderella story, 
Nor did he come to do the same, 
He cant afford to be a label in this day in age, 
And at this stage of the game 
Mediocrity cannot be allowed to fly, 
So say bye, 
to the old H I 
to the new, Que Sera 
Consider it his last hurrah 
Coup de grace 
Raise em high in the sky, 
Keep em up 
Time to bring the place alive, 
Thanks for bein patient 
I will make no more mistakes, 
Shit my potatoes baked, 
Homie the veggies on my plate can fly, 
My filet is smoking weed, 
yea faggot the stakes (steaks) are high 
Shit I aint even suppose to be here
By the grace of god, 
The skin on my teeth 
And the hair on my nuts I skated by, 
Now y'all are on thin ice 
With ankle weights I hate to lie, 
How fuckin irritated are you, 
How much in ya face am i, 
And ain't shit you can do but fear it 
Proof is here in spirit

Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyrics,

Intro: 
Where's my snare? 
I have no snare on my headphones
There you go 
Yeah 
Yo yo 

Verse 1 
Have you ever been hated, or discriminated against? 
I have, I've been protested and demostrated against 
Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times 
Sick as the mind, of the mothafuckin' kid that's behind 
All this commotion, emotions run deep as oceans explodin' 
Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin' 
Not takin' nothin' from no one, give em hell long as I'm breathin' 
Keep kickin' ass in the mornin', and takin' names in the evenin' 
Leave them with a taste sour as vinegar in they mouth 
See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out 



Look at me now, I betcha prolly sick of me now 
Ain't you mama, I'ma make you look so ridiculous now 

Chorus (2x) 
I'm sorry mama 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet 

One More Time 

I said, 
I'm sorry mama 
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant make you cry 
But tonight, I'm cleanin' out my closet 
Ha! 

Verse 2 
I got some skeletons in my closet 
And I don't know if no one knows it 
So before they throw me inside my coffin and close it 
Imma expose it, I'll take you back to '73 
Before I ever had a multi-platinum sellin' CD 
I was a baby maybe I was just a couple of months 
My faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch 
'Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye 
No I don't, on second thought I just fuckin' wished he would die 
I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side 
Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I try to make it work 
With her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes 
But I'm only human but I'm man enough to face 'em today 
What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb 
But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun 
Cause I'd of killed 'em, shit I woulda shot Kim and them both 
It's my life, I'd like to welcome ya'll to The Eminem show 

Chorus (2x) 

Verse 3 
Now I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition 
Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin' 
But put yourself in my position, just try to envision 
Witnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen 
Bitchin' that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missin' 
Goin' through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen Syndrome 
My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 
'Til I grew up, now I blew up it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it? 
Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, MA? 
So you could try to justify the way you treated me, MA? 
But guess what, your gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely
And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that your phoney 
And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful 
But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral *hahaha* 
See what hurts me the most, is you wont admit you was wrong 
Bitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom 
But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get 
You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit! 
Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? 
Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be!! 

Chorus (2x) 




Cause some things just don't change 
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name 
So on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game 
Ooooohhhhhhh 
It shouldn't be difficult to explain 
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame 
Love the game, cold as ice you remain 
Fuck em' all, tell 'em all eat shit, here we go again 

So, god damn... is it that time again already 
Haha, you don't look too happy to see me 
Fuck man, don't everybody welcome me back at once 
All right, fuck ya'll then 

You can get the dick, just call me the ballsac, I'm nuts 
Michael Vick in this bitch, fall back you mutts 
Fuck your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy 
Fuck it a sick duck, I want my duck sick mummy 
And my nuts, lick, gobble 'em up trick, yummy 



Bitch you don't fucking think I know that you suck dick dummy? 
You'll get your butt kicked, fuck all that love shit honey 
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny! 
Shawty dance while I diss you to the beat, fuck the words 
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker 
Motherfucker might aswell let my lips pucker 
Like Elton John, cause I'm just a mean cock sucker 
This shit is on, cause you went and pissed me off 
Now I'm sitting and pissing on everybody 
Give a fuck if it's right or wrong 
So buck the buddah, light a bong 
But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, cmon 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows 
When it snows and it's twenty be-low 
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know 
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows 
Oh oh oh oh oh 

Fuck it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth 
Ya'll are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standing 
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out 
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not fucking around motherfucker 
I'll show you pussy footin, I'll kick a bitch in the cunt 
Til it makes her queef and sounds like a fucking whoopy cushion 
Who the fuck is you pushin', you musta mistook me for some sissy 
Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom 
Go ahead, fucking hater push me 
I told you ain't no fucking way to shush me 
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy 
Man the fuck up sissy, G's up 
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!) 
Man chill, nah I can't god damnit 
Rap is a landfill, drop the anvil 
These are shoes that you can't fill 
Shit the day that happens the world'll stop spinning 
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a stand still 
During an earthquake, urine in your face 
Cause you're fake, ahh what the fuck, that hurt wait! 
Ahh what the fuck, I just got struck by lightening 
Alright then I quit, god I give up 
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do 
This is for your sins, I cleanse you 
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue 
To hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows 
When it snows and it's twenty be-low 
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know 
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows 
Oh oh oh oh oh 

How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day 
Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say 
So long, til then I drop the fucking bombs 
Like I miss the pass when I went long 
If you don't like it you can kiss my ass in a lint thong 
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song 
Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women 
When the aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming 
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo so 
So don't compare me to them other bums over there 
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah 
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair 
But I swear, you try to diss me, I'll slaughter you 
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune 
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit out a rhyme 
And say I was writing this and I thought of you so 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows 
When it snows and it's twenty be-low 
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know 
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows 
Oh oh oh oh oh 

Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
I don't know, I don't know what caused, I don't know what caused me to be this way 
I don't know, I don't know but I probably be this way 'til my dying day 
I don't know why I'm so, I'm so cold beat bangs, I don't need to say 
I guess this is how you made me
